## Description:

Welcome to my Drowsiness Detection Android App! My app utilizes advanced face mesh detection technology, adapted from the powerful Mediapipe framework, to provide you with convenient and potentially life-saving functionality.

By continuously analyzing the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) in real-time, my app assesses whether the user is awake or on the verge of falling asleep. If the user's eyes are closed for more than 3 seconds, the app triggers an alert indicating potential drowsiness. This timely alert serves as a reminder to stay alert and can be a crucial safety feature for drivers, professionals, and anyone at risk of fatigue-related accidents.

Stay awake and stay safe on the road and in various contexts where attentiveness matters. Whether you're driving long distances, working late hours, or engaged in any activity where staying awake is essential, my Drowsiness Detection App will be your trusty companion to help you stay alert and focused.
