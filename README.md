#Drowsiness Detection Android App

Welcome to my Drowsiness Detection Android App! My app utilizes advanced face mesh detection technology, adapted from the powerful Mediapipe framework, to provide you with convenient and potentially life-saving functionality.

Key Features:

Built on Mediapipe Face Mesh Detection: We have harnessed the capabilities of Mediapipe's face mesh detection framework as the backbone of our app. This cutting-edge technology enables accurate tracking of facial landmarks, which serves as the foundation for our drowsiness detection algorithm.

Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR): Our app measures the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), a scientific metric based on the position of the eyes' landmarks, to determine the user's level of alertness. The EAR is a key indicator used by professionals to monitor fatigue and drowsiness levels effectively.

Detecting Drowsiness: By continuously analyzing the EAR in real-time, my app assesses whether the user is awake or on the verge of falling asleep. If the user's eyes are closed for more than 3 seconds, the app triggers an alert indicating potential drowsiness. This timely alert serves as a reminder to stay alert and can be a crucial safety feature for drivers, professionals, and anyone at risk of fatigue-related accidents.

Stay Awake, Stay Safe: My app is designed to keep you and others safe on the road and in various contexts where staying awake and alert is of utmost importance. Whether you're driving long distances, working late hours, or engaged in any activity where attentiveness matters, My Drowsiness Detection App will be your trusty companion to help you stay awake and focused.
